     * DepositFunds XML Builder method All Parameters (incl optional arguments)
     * This method creates the xml format that is accepted by the Yo Payments
     * server.
     * 
     * @param CurrencyCode - Specify here the standard code of the currency in
     *            which you wish to perform the transfer. Note that (a) you must
     *            have a positive balance in the currency you specify; and (b)
     *            you must specify a valid currency code. Examples of valid
     *            currency codes are UGX forUganda Shillings, KES for Kenyan
     *            Shillings USD for United States Dollars.
     * @param Amount - This is the amount to be transferred. This amount will be
     *            debited from your Payment Account (plus applicable fees) and
     *            credited to the Payment Account of the beneficiary. Fractional
     *            amounts are supported. - <b>Mandatory</b>
     * @param BeneficiaryAccount - This is a numerical value representing the
     *            account number of the Payment Account to which you are
     *            transferring the funds, i.e the beneficiary account number.
     *            Obtain this account number from the user to whom you are
     *            transferring the funds. You must provide a valid account
     *            number for the transaction to succeed - <b>Mandatory</b>
     * @param BeneficiaryEmail - Provide here the email address of the recipient
     *            of the funds. You must provide a valid email address for the
     *            transaction to succeed. The Yo! Payments transaction processor
     *            will attempt to match the values you provide in the
     *            BeneficiaryAccount and BeneficiaryEmail with the values stored
     *            in the database. If they do not match, the transaction will
     *            not succeed.
     * @param Narrative - Textual narrative about the transaction. Enter here a
     *            sentence describing the transaction. Provide a maximum of 4096
     *            characters here. If you wish to provide more information,
     *            consider using the Extended parameter method with
     *            NarrativeFileBase6. - <b>Mandatory</b>
     * @param NarrativeFileName - This parameter enables you to attach a file to
     *            the transaction. This is useful, for example, in the case
     *            where you may want to attach a scanned receipt, or a scanned
     *            payment authorization, depending on your internally
     *            established business rules. This parameter requires you to
     *            provide the name of the file you are attaching, as a string,
     *            for example eceipt.doc or receipt.pdf. Note that the
     *            contents of this parameter are ignored if you have not
     *            provided the contents of the file using NarrativeFileBase64
     *            below. <b>Optional</b>
     * @param InternalReference - In this field, provide an internal transaction
     *            reference. If this transfer is related to another system
     *            transaction, enter its reference code in this field. If you
     *            are unsure about the meaning of this field, do not include it
     *            in your request. This field is useful in linking this request
     *            to another existing transaction which is already in the
     *            system. <b>Optional</b>
     * @param ExternalReference - In this field, enter an external transaction
     *            reference. An external transaction reference is something
     *            which yourself and the benecifiary agree upon. For example,
     *            this may be an invoice number, or a phrase describing the
     *            purpose of this transaction in a way that the beneficiary
     *            would understand. This field is optional and you may omit it
     *            in your request. <b>Optional</b>
